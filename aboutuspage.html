        <div class="milestone-text" data-pos="15">
            
            Second Kick Sports Foundation was born from a deep passion for football and a desire to give back to the community.
            <br> Our founder, inspired by a chance encounter with a young boy asking for football lessons, started Second Kick Ghaziabad Football Club.
            <br> What began as a small dream now has two thriving centers in Ghaziabad, providing young athletes with the opportunity to follow their passion.
            <br>With a mission to serve those in need, the foundation was created to offer underprivileged children access to football training, life skills, and, in the future, health and educational support. We aim to empower these children, helping them reach their full potential and build a brighter future.
           <br>Join us in giving every child the opportunity to chase their dreams, on and off the field.
